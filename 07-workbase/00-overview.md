## What is Workbase?
The Grakn Workbase, along with the [Grakn Console](../02-running-grakn/02-console.md) and the [Grakn Clients](../03-client-api/00-overview.md), is an interface through which we can read from a Grakn knowledge graph.
Workbase allows us to execute Graql [`get`](../11-query/02-get-query.md) and [`compute path`](../11-query/07-compute-query.md#compute-the-shortest-path) queries, and visualise and investigate their results.
Whether you need a tool to test and experiment with your newly created Grakn knowledge graph, or that you prefer a graphical interface for reading data from Grakn, you will find Workbase extremely useful.
