## Investigate
Once we have executed a [Graql query](/docs/query/overview) and visualised its result, we can then investigate each node further to obtain more insights.

<div class="note">
[Important]
For the purpose of demonstration, we be interacting with the `phone_calls` keyspace. If you'd like to follow the instructions below step-by-step and see the results accordingly, you need to have modeled the `phone_calls` knowledge graph, loaded its schema into a keyspace and migrated the dataset into it. To do so, follow the [Phone Calls Example](...).

### Configure Display Settings
Having selected a node, we can choose what colour it should be presented in and what attributes should be displayed on the node.

### Visualise Attributes
To visualise the attributes of a node, we first need to select the node by clicking on it and then _hold shift and double click_ on the node.

<div class="note">
[Note]
The number of attributes to visualise is limited by the _Neighbour Limit_ value configured in the [Query Settings](/docs/workbase/visualising#configure-query-settings).
</div>

### Visualise Neighbours
To visualise neighbours of a node, we first need to select the node by clicking on it and then _double click_ on the node. It's important to note that, the neighbours of a concept vary based on its type.

Neighbours of an entity concept are the **relations** in which the entity plays a role in.

Neighbours of an attribute concept are the **things** that own it.

Neighbours of a relation concept are the **things** that play a role in it.

<div class="note">
[Note]
The number of neighbours to visualise is limited by the _Neighbour Limit_ value configured in the [Query Settings](/docs/workbase/visualising#configure-query-settings).
</div>

### Select Multiple Nodes
To select more than one node, we need to _hold the command/control key_ while clicking on each node of interest.

### Delete a Node
