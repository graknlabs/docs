# GRAKN.AI Documentation

This repository contains all content that powers the Grakn Documentation Portal, accessible at [dev.grakn.ai](http://dev.grakn.ai).


## Contribute

- Fork this repository
- Read the [Contribution Guidelines]() carefully
- Make the desired changes.
- Issue pull request(s) and select the `base` branch in accordance with the Branch Classifications.

## Branch Classifications

The classification of the branches and the purpose of each is as follows:

### Master

The master branch contains the content for the live documentation of the current release.
PRs that have the `master` branch as their _base_, contain one or more of the following changes:
- fixing a linguistic mistake
- reflecting a change in the terminology
- rephrasing textual content
- adding complementary content to an existing feature
- updating images
- other changes of the same nature

Given a PR made on `master` that can and should be reflected in the next release as well, a second identical (or slightly different) PR needs to be made on one of the `development` branches. The steps required to issue the second PR is as follows. While on the _head_ branch of the first PR, run:
1. `git checkout development`
2. `git pull <name of the graknlabs/docs remote> development`
3. `git checkout -b <name of the branch to be the head of the upcoming PR>`
4. `git cherry-pick <SHA of the commit that represents the beginning of your change in previous PR>..<SHA of the commit that represents the beginning of your change in previous PR>`
5. commit any other changes that are exclusive to the next release
5. `git push <name of the fork remote> <name of the current branch>`
6. issue the PR and select `development` as the _base_ branch

### Development

The development branch contains the content of the documentation for the next immediate release.
PRs that have the `development` branch as their _base_, contain changes that are either:
- previously made on `master` and should also be reflected for the next release, or
- meant to introduce a new future/change that will only be available as a part of the next release

- [Tests](#tests)

### Naming Conventions

**Files and directories**

- Separate words with hyphens (`-`).
- Keep file and directory names compact: in most cases, one or two words that best describe the contained content. Never use more than three words.
- Choosing the same name for different files located in different directories is acceptable. (eg: `files/social-network/schema.gql` and `files/phone-calls/schema.gql`).
- For naming images, refer to the [Images Guidelines](#images).


**Headlines**

- Headlines should be phrased in a way that when read the user can determine the question that the text is meant to answer. They should describe a use-case.
- Use primitive verbs (eg: _Manage Keyspaces_ as opposed to _Managing Keyspaces_).

### Using Images

- The name of directories placed under `images/`, corresponds to the name of the section as displayed in the sidebar.
- Name of images, while remaining concise, should be to some level descriptive of their content (eg: `compute_path.png` and `compute_path_subgraph.png` as opposed to `compute_0.png` and `compute_1.png`).
- When an image is used across multiple pages, the **same** image file should be referenced, rather than duplicating the image.
- Screenshots of Workbase should be:
  - named after the UI/UX components of the software itself. (eg: `graql-editor_clear-query.png`).
  - taken at the screen resolution of 1280 x 720.
  - image size of 1147 x 671.
  - consistent in their paddings (position of Workbase's layout within the screenshot).

### Writing Style

**Spelling**

Use American.git st

**Headings**
- There are only two levels of headings used across all markdown files:
  - h2 (`##`)
  - h3 (`###`)
- Use Title Case.
- `###` always comes after a `##`.

**Verbs and Pronouns**

- With rare exceptions, the consistent tense used should be the present tense. (ex: _It returns_ as opposed to _It will return_).
- In most cases, the consistent pronoun is `we`. In individual cases, `you` may better convey the message. Never use `I`.

**Lists (Bullet points)**
- When the list item completes the unfinished sentence before the list, end the list item with a period.
- When the concatenation of list items construct one long sentence, end each list items with a comma with the last one ending with a period.
- Have an introductory sentence prior to the list, when possible.

**Footer Notes and Captions**
- When using a phrase, do not end the line with a period (eg: `Computation of shortest path in Workbase`).
- When using a sentence, end the line with a period. `Click on the plus icon to add a new tab.`.

**Formulations**
- Use paragraphs to provide clarity and flow.
- Fist sentence should describe the content of the entire paragraph at a high level.
- Avoid placing critical information in the middle or end of long paragraphs.
- Keep paragraphs short (up to 4 lines), when possible.
- Prefer short sentences to long ones. Only use complex sentence structures (multiple sentences divided by `,`, `;` or `-`), as last resort.
- Keep sentences concise. If a part of a sentence is adding no value to the point that the sentence is meant to deliver, remove it.
- Avoid the assumption that a sentence is self-explanatory. Even if explained in an earlier sentence, repeat yourself to ensure the sentence can be well-understood, without requiring reference to an earlier text.

<!-- **Grakn Terminology**

**Common Terms** -->

### Writing Markdown

**The Basics**
- Use `**` for bolding text.
- Use ` ``` ` for code blocks.
- Use `#` for headings.

**Code Blocks**

- Include the language name right after the opening ` ``` ` (eg: ` ```graql `)
- To automatically link a code keyword to its corresponding documentation, review and maintain the [`views/autolink-keywords.js`](views/autolink-keywords.js)
- Use ` `` ` within the text, to add inline code. Language is not specified for inline code.

**Tabbed Content**
To add tabbed content, use the following structure.

```html
<div class="tabs light">
[tab:Title 1]
...
[tab:end]

[tab:Title 2]
...
[tab:end]

[tab:Title 3]
...
[tab:end]
</div>
```
- Avoid indents inside the `div` tag.
- When the tabbed content is solely a code block, use the `dark` mode (`class`).
- When the tabbed content includes text, use the `light` mode (`class`).
- In rare occasions, when the tabbed content is solely a Liquid `include` tag, add `data-no-parse` to the `div`.

**Slideshow**

To add slideshows, use the following structure.

```html
<div class="slideshow">

[slide:start]
[header:start]Slide 1[header:end]
[body:start]![Alt text for image 1(path/to/image-1.png)[body:end]
[footer:start]Footer note for slide 1.[footer:end]
[slide:end]

[slide:start]
[header:start]Slide 2[header:end]
[body:start]![Alt text for image 2(path/to/image-2.png)[body:end]
[footer:start]Footer note for slide 2.[footer:end]
[slide:end]

</div>
```

- `header` and `footer` is not required, but encouraged.

**Colored Panels**

To add a coloured panel, use the following structure.

```html
 <div class="note">
      [predefined-title]
      body of the note ...
 </div>
```

In order for the above html/markdown to be presented as a coloured panel, `predefined-title` must map to an object contained within `coloredPanels` accessible in [`views/colored-panels.js`](views/colored-panels.js).

**Colored Labels**

To add an inline coloured label, use the following structure.

```
[Label Title]
```

In order for the above to be presented as a coloured label, the `Label Title` must be included in the `labelsList` accessible in [`views/colored-labels.js`](views/colored-labels.js).

### API References

API references are written and maintained in `.yml` files. In order to work, with these files, you need to have a solid understanding of yaml anchors and references.

Client API reference files are accessible via [`03-client-api/references`](03-client-api/references) and Concept API references via [`04-concept-api/references`](04-client-api/references).

### Tests

- Code blocks that have no language name, will not be tested.
- Code blocks whose language is not `java`, `javascript` or `python` will not be tested.
- Code blocks that follow the `<!-- test-ignore --> flag, will not be tested.
- Code blocks that follow the `<!-- test-delay --> flag, with the flag expected to be removed in the next major or minor release.
- Code blocks of `java`, `javascript` or `python` that are not preceded by any test flags, will be tested as snippets. Learn more about [Snippet Tests](test/snippet/README.md).
- Code blocks that follow the `<!-- test-standalone file-name.extension --> flag, will be tested as standalones. Learn more about [Standalone Tests](test/standalone/README.md).
