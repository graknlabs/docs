## What is a Keyspace?
A keyspace is the outermost container for data in a Grakn knowledge graph, corresponding closely to a relational _database_. As per a relational database, it is commonly known to be good practice to create a single keyspace per application, but it is absolutely fine to create as many keyspaces as your application needs. As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to start off with one keyspace and create more if the requirement arises.

[Important]
Keyspaces are isolated from one another. Even when running on the same Grakn Server, it is not possible to perform operations from one keyspace on another one.

### Creating a Keyspace
We can create a new a keyspace via the Grakn Clients [Java](/docs/client-api/java#client-api-method-create-a-session-keyspace), [Node.js](/docs/client-api/nodejs#client-api-method-create-a-session-keyspace) and [Python](/docs/client-api/python#client-api-method-create-a-session-keyspace) and [Grakn Console](/docs/running-grakn/console#console-options).

### Listing All Keyspaces
We can list all keyspaces of the running Grakn server via the Grakn Clients [Node.js](/docs/client-api/nodejs#client-api-method-retrieve-all-keyspaces) and [Python](/docs/client-api/python#client-api-method-retrieve-all-keyspaces), as well as [Workbase](/docs/workbase/connection#select-a-keyspace).

### Cleaning a Keyspce
Cleaning the keyspace, not to be confused with deletion, wipes out both the data and the schema contained within the keyspace. We can clean a keyspace via [Grakn Console](/docs/running-grakn/console#console-commands).

### Deleting a Keyspace
We can delete a keyspace via the Grakn Clients [Java](/docs/client-api/java#client-api-method-delete-a-keyspace), [Node.js](/docs/client-api/nodejs#client-api-method-delete-a-keyspace) and [Python](/docs/client-api/python#client-api-method-delete-a-keyspace).

### Renaming a Keyspace
Once we have created a keyspace, its name can no longer be changed. The only way to achieve a renamed keyspace is to migrate the data from the keyspace with the old name to the newly created keyspace.
